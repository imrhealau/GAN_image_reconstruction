# GAN_image_reconstruction
This study focuses on exploring the applicability of deep learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), on the seismic trace interpolation problem. We first compare conventional seismic interpolation methods with the machine learning counterpart. Subsequently, we evaluate the performance of GANs in the context of image reconstruction, leveraging simplified datasets. Given the complexity and computational demands ofseismic datasets, we opted to simulate the seismic problem using the more manageable 28x28 pixel MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. These datasets were augmented by introducing masked columns, mimicking the missing trace scenario encountered in seismic data. We employ three GANs, namely Linear model, LeNeT-5, and U-NET, to reconstruct MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images. Our evaluation involves qualitative assessments and examination of losses. Notably, U-NET emerges as the most effective, producing high-definition results closest to the original images, as evidenced by MSE losses. Through this approach, we gained insights into the effectiveness of GANs in handling image reconstruction and their potential in addressing seismic trace interpolation. However, challenges like training instability and feature loss due to missing information highlight the need for further model and hyper-parameters refinement in handling larger and more complex datasets.

The datasets utilized in this study are sourced from the PyTorch dataset library, torchvision.datasets.MNIST() for MNIST datasets and torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST() for Fashion-MNIST datasets. Training and validation sets are imported separately. The Jupyter notebooks for model training, namely gan interpolate linear.ipynb, gan interpolate lenet.ipynb, gan interpolate unet.ipynb, are available on GitHub, along with the plotting notebook gan plots.ipynb. To reproduce the interpolation results using the same masked image, one can utilize the .pth files in the sample pics directory. The PyTorch version used is v2.2.1, and the code was written in Python v3.9.2.
